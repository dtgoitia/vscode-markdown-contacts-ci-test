## Extension development

* Install project dependencies:

  ```shell
  npm install  # do not use `npm ci`
  ```

* To debug the extension in VSCode:

  1. Run TypeScript compiler: `npm run watch`.
  1. Open `src/extension.ts` in your editor.
  1. Press `F5`.
  1. Once the new VSCode instance is launched, select the Markdown language.

* To manually publish the extension:

  1. Set up credentials as environment variables:

      - `VSCODE_PUBLISHER_ID`: publisher ID, see [here][1] for more context.
      - `VSCE_PAT`: personal access token, follow [these instructions][1] to get one.

  1. Publish the extension bumping the version:

      ```shell
      npm run publish minor  # major/minor/patch, see `npm version --help` for more options
      ```

  This will bundle the extension with `webpack` (same as `npm run vscode:prepublish`) and upload it to the extension marketplace.
